= HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL =

To make this source code work under MingW32 environment, I have rewritten
the build system using my own dependency based Makefile program.

To build this package, enter command line and enter:

  make all
  
You just need the MingW compiler set with GNU Make program, no other utilities
are need for this.

Cheers~, Happy chessing~
